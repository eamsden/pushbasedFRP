%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% If the degree you're seeking is NOT Doctor of Philosophy, uncomment

% Uncomment the line below that corresponds to the type of master's

% Some optional commands to change the document's defaults.      %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%\singlespacing
%\oneandonehalfspacing

%\singlespacequote
\oneandonehalfspacequote

\topmargin 0.125in  % Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
            % of your dissertation has incorrect top and
            % bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
            % full page of your dissertation (not the first
            % page of a chapter) and measure the top and
            % bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
            % a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
            % at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
            % least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
            % If the margins are not correct, adjust this
            % value accordingly and re-compile and print again.
            %
            % The default value is 0.125"

        % If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
        % utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
        % the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
        % your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
        % utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
        % made to utdiss2.sty.

I wish to thank the many people who have supported me as I pursued this work. In particular,
my supervisor Dr. Matthew Fluet was both encouraging and challenging as I explored the question posed
by this thesis, and through the long process of revisions and preparing for my defense.
Professor Arthur Nunes-Harwitti's and Dr. Zack Butler's feedback and contributions were invaluable.
I would also like to thank Dr. Ryan Newton for his understanding and encouragement as I worked concurrently
on the beginning of my PhD studies and this thesis. I thank my family, my mother and father in particular, for
their encouragement and support of my education, and for all of the teaching they so diligently gave me to
enable me to reach this point. Finally and most importantly, \textit{Soli Deo gloria}.

% Including external files for each chapter makes this document simpler,
% makes each chapter simpler, and allows for generating test documents
% with as few as zero chapters (by commenting out the include statements).
% This allows quicker processing by the Makediss command file in case you
% are not working on a specific, long and slow to compile chapter. You
% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own
% dissertation).
