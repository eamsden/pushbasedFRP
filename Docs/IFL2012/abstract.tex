\begin{abstract}
Functional Reactive Programming is a promising class of systems for writing
interactive and time-dependent programs. Signal-function FRP is a subclass of
these systems which provides advantages of modularity and correctness, but
has proven difficult to efficiently implement.

The abstraction of signal vectors provides the necessary type apparatus to
distinguish components of the input and output of signal functions which benefit
from a push-based implementation from those which benefit from a pull-based
implementation, and to combine both implementation strategies in a single system.

We describe a signal-function FRP system which provides push-based evaluation
for events, pull-based evaluation for signals, and a simple monadic evaluation
interface which permits the system to be easily integrated with one or more
IO systems.
